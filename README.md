### KDT_PROJECT

<div>
  &nbsp;This is a place where I store a portion of the knowledge accumulated during the 6-month KDT (Korea Digital Training) program at Kyungpook National University.<br> 
  Since June 2023, I have been introduced to various technologies, including Python, Pandas, databases, Flask, machine learning, and deep learning.<br>
<br>
This space encapsulates the moments when my journey as a developer began, and the time spent nurturing and growing the dream.
